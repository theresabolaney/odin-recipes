# odin-recipes

This is an HTML refresher assignment from the Odin Project. The goal is to create three recipe pages and link them from a central index.

To run, simply clone this repo then open the index.html file in a Chrome browser.

Alternatively, you can just navigate to "https://theresabolaney.github.io/odin-recipes/" to see it in action!
